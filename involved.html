      <p class="text-center">For students, the best way to get involved in SWE at UC Berkeley is to join a committee or become an apprentice. In addition, we have a variety of social and professional events we host for students, as well as volunteering opportunities. Every month, we have a general meeting which is open to all students which serves as a great way to meet the officers and learn more about the SWE community. Officer positions open at the end of each semester for those who are interested in applying.</p>

      <p class="text-center"> If you would like to join one of SWE's committees, check back in at the beginning of the semester for committee applications. Applications will be released after the first general meeting of the semester. More information about each committee can be found below.</p>

Mentorship hosts both the professional Mentorship and the SWEster program, and thus committee members will be responsible for managing the logistics, publicity, and personal relations of each event. You'll be emailing dozens of professional women in the Bay Area, and this is a fantastic opportunity to expand your network and learn more about what engineering looks like from your peers and beyond.

Responsibilities range from emailing professors to invite them to events, helping match hosts with students that will stay on campus with current female engineering students, and designing our new logo for the year! This is a wonderful opportunity if you have been positively affected by OHP yourself and/or are looking for a way to give back to the community that made you feel a part of the College of Engineering your freshman year. We look forward to meeting you and working with you as part of the SWE OHP committee.

The company and project is of each team’s choosing. Teams are evaluated both on the end product quality and the ability of the team to work together. Project proposals may be submitted during the fall semester after which teams may begin their work. The final report is due at the end of the spring semester, and the presentations occur at the SWE fall conference.

              The Professional Development Month Committee is responsible for organizing Professional Development Month, a month long series of career development workshops (each partnered with an engineering company) aimed to prepare students seeking career experience. Committee members will be responsible for managing the logistics, publicity, and corporate relations of each event. We highly recommend this committee to anyone interested in event planning (you will be responsible for managing specific events as "day heads") and corporate relations!

              Mini-University is a free one-day event on March 15th designed to encourage underserved bay-area 9th-11th grade students to pursue careers in STEM and is open to all genders. As a volunteer you will be leading students on lab tours, helping with hands-on engineering activities, and sharing your engineering experiences with the high schoolers. If you are interested in helping out with a specific component such as through a 15 minute lightning talk, student panel, or have other ideas for how you would like to help out (ex. activity ideas or labs we could tour), join the Mini-U committee!

              SWENext aims to encourage high school females to explore STEM and consider a STEM career by helping them establish SWENext clubs at their high schools. We provide students with resources to help them navigate high school, college, and career planning. We also have a mentorship program that connects high schoolers with undergraduate mentors to advise, support, and inspire them to pursue their interests in STEM. Join SWENext committee to be part of a community that works with youth to increase representation in STEM fields! This year, we will be splitting into the following subcommittees: website development, mentorship, social media, activities, and SWENext Day (in the spring). If you are interested in any of the areas, please reach out to us to apply.

              SWE Science is a hands-on engineering program held from 10AM to 11:30AM on Saturday mornings. The program is divided into two sections: SWE Science Saturdays for 4th-5th grade and SWE Science Scholars for 6th-8th grade students. During these sessions, students will engage in engineering challenges designed to allow students to not only practice foundational STEM principles but also to develop their intellectual curiosities and creativity. Previous activities have included cardboard vehicles, flotation devices, and plastic parachutes. If you are interested in planning and volunteering for our events this semester, please reach out!

The first 9 weeks covers an interactive curriculum in Scratch and Python that our teachers and volunteers create and teach. The final week of the course is a full day of coding and engineer workshops called Code Day. Unlike the previous 9 weeks, Code Day is open to up to 100 girls in the area, allowing more girls access to a hands-on experience with technology.

This event features various hands-on science activities for the students and their parents/guardians to try out themselves, exploring many science and engineering concepts. Due to the virtual setting of this year’s Engineering Day, around 50 students (as well as their chaperones) are expected, who will be able to follow along (at home) through the virtually guided activities.

              SWE’s Parent Education Program (PEP) is a 30 to 60-minute workshop in which we share important research, experiences, and resources to ensure that families have access to tools that not only encourage but also further their children’s STEM education beyond the classroom. We believe that the value of a holistic approach to supporting STEM education cannot be understated. Thus, in addition to UC Berkeley SWE’s typical outreach programs for students, we are organizing this program geared towards parents and families. Our mission is to provide parents with the knowledge and resources to support their children’s STEM education regardless of family background.

              Do you want an opportunity to get more involved in SWE by giving back to its members? Being an apprentice for the social committee allows you the opportunity to foster a stress-free environment, with guaranteed laughter and smiles. Help coordinate fun activities with the Membership Director. It is a great stepping stone into becoming a more active SWEster and be able to see a behind-the-scene glimpse in the planning process.

              The Intersocietal Apprentice will help the Intersocietal Chair organize and implement creative social events for SWE and between other engineering organizations. The Intersocietal Apprentice and Intersocietal Chair will work together to foster an attitude of communal growth and work to maintain SWE’s social presence in the engineering community. Some events that the apprentice will be responsible for planning with the Chair will include the Professor’s Lunch, an intersocietal trivia night, and other fun intersocietal events, such as a potential DIY Boba Bar!  This apprenticeship will be a great way to obtain invaluable event planning experience, while having fun and meeting fellow engineers, as well!
