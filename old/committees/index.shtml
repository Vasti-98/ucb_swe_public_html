Inspire and be inspired! As a member of SWE Outreach you will have the pleasure of working with enthusiastic young minds from the Berkeley area on exciting engineering based activities. Events such as SWE Science aim to spark children's interests in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Our events are opportunities for primary and secondary school students to explore the thrills and challenges of engineering; and to be honorary engineers for a day! In addition, Outreach events are a great opportunity for you to take on mentorship and leadership roles. We are always looking for clever new ideas and projects to put on, and we need your help to lead the events. Get involved with Outreach to pass along your passion for STEM to bright, excited young minds!<br>

<h3>Shadow an Engineer (SAE)</h3>
    <p>
    Chairs: Apoorva Dornadula and Nikki Panditi (corporate.ucbswe@gmail.com)
	</p><p>
	SWE's Shadow An Engineer Program (SAE) provides Berkeley students the opportunity to experience an externship in their Technical field of choice. This shadowing opportunity can help give a student a realistic look at careers in their field, and may serve as a stepping stone to a longer internship. Companies who participate in SAE gain access to recruitment opportunities among some of berkeley's brightest rising engineers, and gain brand name visibility within that hiring pool. This mutually beneficial partnership results in some enriching, eye-opening development opportunities.    </p>
