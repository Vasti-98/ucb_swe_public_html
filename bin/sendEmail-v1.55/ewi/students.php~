  tell us exactly what candidates they look for. Please bring any questions
  you would like to ask and get ready for EWI! This is the first time we
  open the workshop for everyone (in the past only for people who purchased
  EWI tickets) so don\'t miss out! It will be a great night with yummy free
  dinner!
