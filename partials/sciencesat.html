        <strong> Attention returning SWE Science Saturday Parents:</strong> Welcome back! The sign up process
        has been changed from previous years. It is described below, with major changes in <strong>BOLD</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>SWE Science Saturdays are 2 hour fun engineering lessons and challenges from 10am-12pm for 4th and 5th
    	graders from local elementary schools. Spaces are given to those who register on a first come first serve basis!
      </p>
      <p>
    	A $2 dollar donation is suggested but not required from students to cover the cost of supplies. In contrast to
    	previous years, we are no longer using PayPal for donations, so this donation would be in-person at the event
    	should you choose to give one.
      </p>
      <p>
    	**Note: In the past, we have been fairly lenient about letting students who are not registered for a class attend
    	because our classes were smaller and we love doing science experiments with your students! However, safety is our
    	first priority, and as a result we are no longer able to accommodate students who are not registered. Having more
    	students than we planned for presents a risk because we do not have enough volunteers to supervise all your students
    	and make sure they are accounted for and safe. Thank you!
      </p>

      <h3>Sign-up:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
        Your child must be in 4th or 5th grade
        (if older - please see <a href="#/sciencescholar">SWE Science Scholars</a>)
        </li>
        <li>

    Please note that the registration process has changed from previous years. We will now be doing monthly pre-registrations  in order to maximize the number of students who are able to participate in our classes. Registration for the event begins the Monday after the previous month's SWE Science Saturday at 5 PM PST. Please fill out the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/1U0bXB55048RGQ933" target="_blank">SWE Science Saturdays form</a> ASAP to ensure that your child has a chance to participate.
    These are the dates for the Spring 2016 Semester of SWE Science Saturdays:

        <strong>
          Please note: In contrast to previous years, filling out the SWE Science Saturday Form does not
    necessarily mean you are registered for the class. You will receive an email confirmation the Monday before the SWE Science event informing you as to whether you have gotten into the
    class, are waitlisted, or if the class is all full.
