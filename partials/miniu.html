        Hello everyone, <br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="row">
      I have just received word that UC Berkeley classes are cancelled tomorrow, and that campus itself will be shut down.  Unfortunately, this means that Mini-University can no longer take place tomorrow as planned.
      

        SWE will be hosting Mini-University next semester in mid-March 2019, with registration opening in mid-February.  I highly encourage all of you to attend the spring program.  You can sign up to receive an alert when registration opens at the following <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/miniu-notification"> link</a></strong>. 
      
        I have attached a list of STEM resources and programs that we had planned to distribute during the program tomorrow.  I hope that you take advantage of one or many of the STEM camps, classes, or programs in your area.  Also included is a brief overview of a few of the careers you can undertake as a STEM major.  
      
        I am happy to answer any questions you may have.  I hope to see you in the Spring - take care of yourselves!

        Mini-University is a one-day event designed to encourage underserved bay-area high school students to pursue careers in STEM.  Participants will tour academic labs, learn about STEM career paths, participate in engineering activities, hear from STEM professors and current engineering students, and much more!  Spots are limited and applications are accepted on a first-come-first-served basis, with priority given to students from underserved communities.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="unbold sweGray">
        Mini-University is open to students of all genders.  We especially encourage students from first-generation, low-income, and/or minority backgrounds to apply.  This event is geared towards 9th, 10th, and 11th grade students who are considering majoring in stem, tech, engineering, or math related fields (or who simply want to learn more about what a STEM career would be like!)
