    <h4>SWE Science Saturdays & Scholars:</h4>
    <p>
    SWE Science Saturdays (for 4th and 5th graders), and SWE Science Scholars (for 6th through 8th graders) are two hour events that take place on one Saturday of each month on the UC Berkeley campus and have a capacity of about 30 students each. At these events, students have an opportunity to participate in one or more hands-on engineering activities. Please email <script type="text/javascript">

    <h4>JSSC:</h4>
    <p>
    JSSC is an event that takes place from 8am to about 2pm one Saturday in Spring Semester at the Lawrence Hall of Science. 6th through 8th graders create solar powered cars using some base materials from a JSS kit they can order online, and come up to the Lawrence Hall to race them against each other. Their cars are judged by members of CalSol. To find out how to be a part of this event, email <script type="text/javascript">

    <h4>Engineering Day: Saturday, 10/22 </h4>
    <p>
Engineering Day is an event for K-3rd graders that takes place every October around Halloween. At this event, K-3rd graders and their parents drop by any time over the course of about 3 hours to take part in a carnival-style event, with booths where they can take part in short Halloween-themed science activities. We had over 100 kids attend the event last year, and it is a lot of fun because they come in their costumes and everything is Halloween-themed! For more information, email
