            <p>
The outreach committee plans events to introduce K-12 grade students to science and engineering and inspire them to pursue a career in STEM. As a committee member, you can lead hands-on engineering activities at our events, volunteer with students, and help with the event planning process. Join the committee to share your passion for engineering and give back to the community!
<!-- Inspire and be inspired! As a member of SWE Outreach you will have the pleasure of working with enthusiastic young minds from the Berkeley area on exciting engineering based activities. Events such as SWE Science aim to spark children's interests in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Our events are opportunities for primary and secondary school students to explore the thrills and challenges of engineering; and to be honorary engineers for a day! In addition, Outreach events are a great opportunity for you to take on mentorship and leadership roles. We are always looking for clever new ideas and projects to put on, and we need your help to lead the events. Get involved with Outreach to pass along your passion for STEM to bright, excited young minds! -->

	    SWE is hosting the third annual Professional Development Month (PDM) this fall! PDM is a month-long series of events with members of industry to equip engineering students with the knowledge and tools to secure a job or internship. The events will focus on cruising a career fair, acing the interview, and more! All events will be served with food. PDM is currently putting together a committee of 8 day chairs and 2 publicists to bring the event together. If interested, talk to Francesca Ledesma or Aly Scheske at SWE GM1 or apply here: https://goo.gl/forms/MgDLS5s1Q62T9Pel1.
