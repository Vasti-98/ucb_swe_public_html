Inspire and be inspired! As a member of SWE Outreach you will have the pleasure of working with enthusiastic young minds from the Berkeley area on exciting engineering based activities. Events such as SWE Science aim to spark children's interests in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Our events are opportunities for primary and secondary school students to explore the thrills and challenges of engineering; and to be honorary engineers for a day! In addition, Outreach events are a great opportunity for you to take on mentorship and leadership roles. We are always looking for clever new ideas and projects to put on, and we need your help to lead the events. Get involved with Outreach to pass along your passion for STEM to bright, excited young minds!

            <p>The Public Relations committee is in charge of keeping SWE members in the loop about SWE events and opportunities. The main ways in which we do this are through preparing and distributing the weekly SWEmail, producing the newsletter that is distributed at general meetings, flyering around campus, chalking messages in classrooms, and posting social media updates including Facebook and Twitter. If you have a passion for writing, photography, design, communications/social media, or just an interest in public relations then we would love to have you join our team!
