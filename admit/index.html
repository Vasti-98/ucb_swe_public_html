<p>
<b>Tell me about your 2011 OHP self.</b> 
</p><p>
Amy: I was a second semester freshman, recently declared EECS major, who was eager to share my love for Berkeley with incoming students. Although classes had made me a tad more bitter than I had been coming in to college, I still had so many great experiences to draw on that I wanted to share it with the people whose shoes I had been in a year ago. So, I signed up to be a host for SWE's Overnight Host Program.
</p><p>
Paroma: I was one of the students who had accepted my admission to Berkeley the same day it came out, without waiting for the results from other colleges. I was from the Bay Area, so I had visited Berkeley throughout high school, and had fallen in love with the campus on my first visit. With OHP, I had the opportunity to visit the campus again, but now view it through the perspective of an incoming freshman! I had heard about the ratio of women in engineering, so I was also looking forward to meeting other female engineers and find a few friends even before starting college!
</p><p>
<b>What did you do during the day?</b>
</p><p>
Amy: The morning was just another ordinary day for me. I had math lecture, math discussion, CS61A lecture, and Theater 126 lecture. The only interesting thing to note was that in CS61A lecture, in the same row as me, sat a group of 10 or so girls from the SWE OHP program. It's weird to think that my future hostee at the time was sitting only a few feet away from me. Life can be funny, don't you think?
</p><p>
Paroma: I attended two lectures in Pimentel Hall, one of the largest classrooms on campus. My favorite was the 61A lecture, where I had the opportunity to hear the legendary Brian Harvey (who had been teaching the class for around 25 years) teach basic data structures. Next, we had the opportunity to interact with a few women faculty in engineering and representatives from a few engineering clubs on campus. The best part of the day was dinner at the Faculty Club, where a three course dinner with faculty members and other prospective students was followed by a performance by the UC Men's Octet. 
</p><p>
<b>What did you do in the evening?</b>
</p><p>
Amy: At the evening OHP activities in Soda, I wandered from the ir-resistor-able jewelry room to the snack room before finally settling down in the movie room. Then came the time for hosts and hostees to be paired up. I said I was going to Foothill and asked if anyone wanted to come with me and one girl jumped up and said she would go. Her name was Paroma Varma, and she was an intended EECS major from Fremont. We lugged her suitcase up the hill from Soda to the La Loma elevator then to Hillside building 6. My suite was hosting 4 other students, so I introduced myself and Paroma to them. We spent the night chatting and answering any questions the prospective students had. It was a late night. 
</p><p>

<b>Did you learn anything new about Paroma/Amy?</b>
</p><p>
A: Everything! But she was an officer of her school's French Club, while she took three years of Spanish
</p><p>
P: Amy is/was obsessed with Vampire Weekend. She even went to a concert at the Greek Theatre!
</p><p>
<b>Did you learn anything new about yourself?</b>
</p><p>
Amy: Around April of spring semester, I think many of us just want the school year to be over. We're tired and burnt out from school work because let's face the truth: Berkeley is hard. To be a Berkeley engineer is no walk in the park. Classes are frustrating. Professors can be aloof. Classmates can be aggressively competitive. Sometimes you just need a break from it all. And when someone tells you  that you need to convince a bunch of high school students to come to Berkeley, you might just feel that you can't do it. I mean, how could you tell a bunch of high schoolers how great of a school Cal is when you're miserable? But I actually found the experience rather therapeutic. Answering these prospective students' questions reminded me just how much I love it here. It reminded me how much I learn in classes, how supportive professors are, and how much fun my classmates can be. The more I talked about why I came here, what I love most about it, and what sets Berkeley apart from other schools, the greater appreciation I found for this university. And it felt amazing to regain that awe I once had when I first stepped onto this campus as a wide-eyed and excited first semester freshman.
</p><p>
P: I always considered myself a fairly shy person. But for some reason after going through the different events at OHP, I was surprised to see myself being proactive and talking to other prospective undergraduates and speakers that we had. I didn't realize that just being at Berkeley would energize me enough to (almost) turn me into an extrovert. Berkeley instantly felt like home, a place where I could be myself and still find peers who were interested in the same thing as me. 
</p><p>
<b>Is there anything you would do differently?</b>
</p><p>
Amy: It was kind of late by the time we picked up our hostees, around 9pm I believe, and the prospective freshmen were supposed to be at the College of Engineering Cal Day breakfast at 9am the next morning, but I would have liked the opportunity to show Paroma a bit more of the student social life. I guess being a freshman at the time, I didn't know as much about the city of Berkeley as I do now, but I think it would have been nice to do some research and show her the places that she may not have seen in her previous visits here.
</p><p>
P: I wish I had stayed up all night before Cal Day learning about the student life as much as I could. Although the planned activities were really great, it might have nice to have the opportunity to wander around campus without dealing with Cal Day crowds, and learn about the cool buildings/sights on campus.
</p><p>
<b>What are you up to today? (AKA Tell me about your present day self)</b>
</p><p>
Amy: Today, I'm a fourth year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major. I have successfully lived through three and a half years of academic requirements, social situations, career fair swag and infosession food. I have taken classes in data structures, algorithms, databases, networking, systems and signals, circuits, tap, jazz, ballet, voice, acting, and sleep psychology. I have made countless friends both female and male, engineering and not. I have been interviewed by the Daily Cal, named a Berkeley Engineer of the Week, and learned how to solve a rubik's cube in under a minute. I will be graduating this semester in May, and I plan on working full-time as a software engineer at Google later this year. Oh, and I'm also the current president of SWE, and did I mention that Paroma is now my Vice President of Corporate? And I participate in OHP every year.
</p><p>
P: I am currently the SWE VP of Corporate Relations! In the past three years, I have switched tracks from computer science to electrical engineering, attended several hackathons (even one at UPENN), interned at Intel, almost minored in Psychology (unfortunately, there is no such thing as a Psychology minor), and adopted the electrical engineering building, Cory Hall, as my second home. Currently, I am doing research in a neuroscience lab and a digital imaging lab, while working as the EECS Peer Advisor. I've managed to learn how to balance my time, take care of my health, study, work, and have fun, all at the same time. The opportunity to interact with such passionate students and faculty keeps me motivated to work hard and keep exploring, even as a junior :)

<b>Additional Comments?</b>
</p><p>
Amy: Writing this has made me feel rather nostalgic, looking back on the person I used to be and the person I am today. It's been quite an adventurous (almost) four years, and I know that I will definitely miss Berkeley and all the people I have met. I can still remember dropping Paroma off in the morning after her stay with me. I felt like a parent, watching her go off on her own. I guess this is what my parents probably feel, and I hope they're proud of the person I have become because I sure am. And I know that Berkeley, with all of its ups and downs, helped me achieve that. And for that, I will always be grateful.
</p><p>
Paroma: Yesterday, I was giving a prospective undergraduate student a tour around campus, when he asked me if I still liked Berkeley as much as I did when I was a freshman. The honest answer is that I like it even more now - despite the challenges it has thrown my way. Berkeley has helped me  find a part of the self-confidence that I had lost when I moved to the United States from India in middle school, it has helped me discover myself.
